The makefile provides simple commands for running
common project-specific docker tasks.
It can be instructive to look in the Makefile to 
see what docker commands and options it uses.

make help  # display this help file

make start # start the web site (usually this is the first thing you do)
make logs  # display and follow the logs for the website as it's running
make tests # run django unit tests
make debug # run the website in a way that allows pdb debugging
make stop  # stop the web site

make shell # open a python shell to the django environment (manage.py shell)
make sql   # open a sql shell in to the django database

make build # force the docker image to rebuild (e.g. if requirements.txt changes)
make clean # delete the project-specfic docker containers and images

To explore other commands you might use, type:
  docker-compose help
  docker help
